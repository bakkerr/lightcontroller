# Light Controller

This application lets you control MiLight (and equivalent) LED bulbs and LED strips controlled by a 2.4GHz WiFi Bridge.

## Features:
  1. Select a color for each zone independently, or through the master (Zone 0)
  2. Master-Master controller for Multiple Bridges (although I have only one currently, so I have not tested this)
  3. Audio triggered effects
  4. Fading

## Get sources
